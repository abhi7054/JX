    <p><b>Our Privacy Philosophy.</b></p>

    </p>At Johnny Xtreme Comics we are determined to ensure that our visitors, customers and friends will have a fun
    experience while using this app, without sacrificing their peace of mind as to the protection of their identity and
    other personal information. This policy statement tells you how we collect information on you, how it’s used and the
    steps we are taking to protect it from any unauthorized use.</p>

    <p><b>Children’s Online Privacy.</b></p>
    <p>Because many visitors to this app are children, we take the utmost care to make certain that our content is
        appropriate for kids of all ages. We do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary
        for them to participate (e.g. normally just their e-mail address) and we take steps to prevent children from
        posting contact information. Children should obtain permission from a parent or guardian before contacting
        Johnny Xtreme Comics in any regard, especially before entering any personal information (which we expressly
        discourage) or requesting information. Johnny Xtreme Comicsdoes not permit children under the age of 13 to place
        any orders on this app or communicate with us through this app without the express written permission of their
        Parent or Legal Guardian. If Johnny Xtreme Comics has any reason to believe that a visitor under the age of 13
        is posting information, or attempting to purchase merchandise from Our Store, they will be asked to have their
        Parent or Legal Guardian send an e-mail to us to confirm authorization.</p>

    <p>Johnny XtremeComics does not solicit personally identifiable information from children. The Children’s Online
        Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires Websites that cater to children – or know that a visitor to their site
        is a child under the age of 13 – to follow specific Federal Trade Commission rules. In our attempt to fully
        comply with these rules, we would like you to know that:</p>

    <p>** Personally identifiable offline contact information will not be collected without prior parental consent.</p>

    <p>** Personal online contact information will not be solicited and collected without prior parental consent or
        parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and
        the child’s participation in the activity.</p>

    <p>** Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child’s
        request for information and will not be used for other purposes.</p>

    <p>Johnny Xtreme Comics will not entice any child or adult, regardless of their age, to divulge more personal
        information than is needed to use the app or participate in any online activity by offering any special game,
        prize, incentive or other similar activity.</p>

    <p>** In no case will any personally identifiable information be distributed to third parties or otherwise posted,
        EXCEPT in the event of a Business Transfer, Merger, or Buyout of Johnny Xtreme Comics (see below for more
        details).</p>

    <p><b>Information Collection and Use.</b></p>

    ** Johnny Xtreme Comics uses the limited information it collects from visitors, if any, for internal research and
    may use this information to customize the advertising and content seen on our pages.

    <p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure.</b></p>
    <p>** Johnny Xtreme Comics will not contact children under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing
        purposes without parental consent.</p>

    ** Johnny Xtreme Comics will not send personally identifiable information about a child to other companies or
    people, UNLESS we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process – to the extent permitted by
    law.

    <p><b>Ability to Update or Delete Information.</b></p>

    <p>** Parents or Legal Guardians are welcome to request deletion of any information we may have on their child.</p>


    <p>** Please note that information about a child may remain in back-up storage for some period after a request for
        deletion of that child’s account. This may be the case even though no information about that account remains in
        our active user databases.</p>

    <p><b>Johnny Xtreme Comics Use of ‘Cookies’.</b></p>
    <p>To enable many of the features available on our app, we may assign cookies to your Internet browser using
        technology from Google Analytics and similar providers. This unique identification number automatically
        identifies your browser (but not you) to our computers whenever you interact with Our Site. When you visit our
        site, a cookie in effect says to our server computers “Hello, I’m browser #****, what do you do just for me?”
        Only if you agree to provide information on yourself, which we normally discourage, would we be able to know
        anything about you other than the random number that our server computers assign to your browser in the first
        place. Cookies assist you, by assisting us in creating a record of your unique preferences. Johnny XtremeComics
        would only use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they have visited particular pages
        on Our Site. We would not use cookies to indirectly obtain a personal profile on individual visitors, as some
        Website Operators choose to do through the assistance of profiling software.</p>

    <p>Many people are confused about cookies, how they are used and what they can do. Cookies are very small text files
        written by an Internet server to a customer’s browser when information is exchanged. Cookies only contain
        information that the server computer “knew” in the first place and can only be read by the serving domain that
        placed them. Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet works today and allow servers to recognize your
        computer’s browser when you return. If you have ever gone to a web page that automatically provides personalized
        content to you without requiring that you “log in,” this is accomplished using cookies. Since cookies are only
        text files, they cannot “run” on your computer and have no ability to search your computer for other information
        or transmit it to anyone. Cookies are implemented as part of the technology implemented by your web browser.</p>

    <p>Johnny XtremeComics uses similar technology to measure traffic on our comic App. For more information on how the
        information is used on the Johnny Xtreme Comic App, visit Google’s page on Safeguarding Data.</p>

    <p><b>Ordering Merchandise from Our Store.</b></p>

    <p>Visitors who order merchandise or other materials from Our Storewill be required to provide their full name,
        billing and mailing addresses, e-mail address, telephone number and a payment method. If the order is being
        shipped to a third party, we will also need the recipient’s name and mailing address. Before collecting
        information in connection with an order, we will verify the validity of the purchaser’s payment method. On a
        rare occasion, we might solicit additional voluntary information regarding shoppers’ personal shopping
        preferences. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from ordering anything at all from our store without
        the express written permission of their Parent or Legal Guardian.</p>

    <p><b>Business Transfer.</b></p>

    <p>In the event that Xtreme Teez or Johnny Xtreme Comics Online or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a
        third party, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. However, use of any information
        collected on children under the age of 13, if among the transferred assets should such a transaction take place,
        will only be used in accordance with the policies set forth herein in compliance with COPPA.</p>
